## Articles and blogs

In addition to just Q&A, here on Codidact each site can also add several different categories of posts. This is useful for different types of knowlege sharing, as well as for site activities and community building. One of the main types of post categories, aside from Q&A, is articles.

One of the main technical differences between articles and Q&A is that articles can't be answered, as well as having a `/articles/` path in the post URL.

Aside from that, articles can be used in several different ways. Some sites have a blog, where people can post about topics that are of interest to that community, as well as site updates (and, really, whatever that site decides). Other sites use articles to post information that doesn't quite fit in a Q&A format - such as tutorials, reviews, or recommendations.

If your site doesn't currently have articles or a blog, you can post a proposal in your site's meta category with your arguments for why your community would benefit from adding other categories and what categories you'd like to add.
