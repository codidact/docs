**Claiming imported content**

Codidact contains a number of posts imported from Stack Exchange. When these posts are imported, Codidact saves the original author on Stack Exchange and creates a "placeholder" owner on Codidact. The imported posts then are attributed to this placeholder account on Codidact, since the author on Stack Exchange does not necessarily have a Codidact account to attribute the posts to. The posts also link back to the original post on Stack Exchange and to the author on Stack Exchange.

If the owner of an imported post does create a Codidact account, they have the option of claiming the imported content to attribute it to a Codidact account instead. This will automatically remove the links to the Stack Exchange post and user, since the post is then licensed directly to Codidact.

## How do I claim the imported content?

To claim the content, you need to link a Stack Exchange account to your Codidact account. This can be done from your profile settings page on any Codidact communinity that has imported posts, in the "edit" tab on your profile (/users/edit/profile).  
Once you have followed the instructions on the bottom of that page, you will be asked by Stack Exchange to confirm that you want to link an application called "QPixel" with your account. You will have to allow this for the link to work - QPixel is the name for the software that Codidact is running on.  
Once you've finished linking the account, your posts will be automatically linked to your Codidact account. (If you then want to remove Codidact's access to your Stack Exchange account, this can be done from your Stack Exchange account, at /users/apps/current on any Stack Exchange site where you have an account.)

## How do I import new content from Stack Exchange to Codidact?

New content can only be imported by a Codidact developer using a manual process. If you have a list or class of posts you would like to have imported to a Codidact community, please raise this as a requent in the meta category for that community.

## Can I import content from other websites too?

There currently is no infrastructure for importing content from sites other than Stack Exchange.
