# Codidact FAQ

## What is Codidact?

Codidact is an open-source initiative to provide a high-quality, community-controlled, open source Q&A platform. Visit <https://codidact.org> to learn more about the platform we're building to empower anyone to host a Q&A community, or visit <https://codidact.com> to browse our family of sites. 

## Who runs Codidact?

Users just like you! The software is built and hosted by volunteers who are passionate about the need for a community-driven Q&A site. Each site is moderated by a team of dedicated, experienced users who spend their time weeding out spam, coaching newbies, and ensuring questions are on-topic and high-quality. 

## How do I ask a question?

You will need to create an account. Make sure you are logged into the appropriate site for your question. Click the "Ask Question" button and a template will show up. Some sites may require you to have a certain trust level before you ask a question. 

## What are trust levels and how are they calculated?

Trust levels are the system Codidact uses to determine user privileges. Everyone starts at Trust Level 0 and gradually gains the ability to contribute at a higher level. Trust levels are earned by positively contributing to the site. For more information, see <https://github.com/codidact/docs/wiki/User-Privileges>. 

## What does it mean that Codidact is community-controlled? What makes it different from any other Q&A site?

Most Q&A sites are run by companies whose primary goal is to make a profit for their shareholders. This leads to a situation where bringing in revenue can be more important than the health of the community using the site. On Codidact, the users control the sites they use, so there's no conflict of interest between quality and the bottom line.
