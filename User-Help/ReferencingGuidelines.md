## Guidelines for referencing and quoting on Codidact sites

When you're writing a post, referencing and quoting external material is a great way to back up your posts, provide sources, and increase the quality of what you're writing. There are, however, a few thing to keep in mind when quoting external material.

**Referencing online material**

When you're referencing or quoting material that can be found online (such as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/ "English Wikipedia") or similar), **please make sure to include a link**.  
Pay attention to what license the content is published under - for instance, Wikipedia licenses text under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License), which requires attribution and a link back to the original source.


**Referencing offline material**

When quoting from offline material, such as a book, please make sure to always include at a very minimum the **title and author** of the work. Including a chapter number or page number when applicable is ideal.  
Be sure to only quote whatever text is relevant. While quoting for knowlege sharing usually falls under [Fair Use rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), which allows the use of copyrighted material, limiting the sharing of copyrighted works to only what's necessary for your post is in general a good idea.

In any case, whether your original source is online or offline, **please *clearly* mark the quoted material as being quoted** from somewhere and is not your original content. This is done simplest with blockquote formatting (see the [formatting help](/help/formatting) for help with formatting).
