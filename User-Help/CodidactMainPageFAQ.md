# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do we need Codidact when Stack Exchange exists?

Codidact aims to create a Questions & Answers platform that is more than just Q&A: We're here to serve the needs of the community. We differ from Stack Exchange in several core ways, of which perhaps the most significant is that Stack Exchange is a for-profit company while Codidact is currently run by volunteers and incorporated as a UK Community Interest Company. This means that instead of focusing on profit, we can focus entirely on the needs of our communities. You can read more in [The Codidact Vision](https://meta.codidact.com/articles/276296).

## What communities currently exist on Codidact?

You can see a full list of sites on https://codidact.com.

## Where is the source code for Codidact?

All of the source code for the project can be found in repositories by the [Codidact organization on GitHub](https://github.com/codidact/). The main code for the Q&A sites can be found in the [QPixel repository](https://github.com/codidact/qpixel).
