# How to ask a great question

The best way to get a perfect answer to your questions is to ask a great question. The better your question is, the easier it will be for someone to be able to give you the answer you need. Here are a few things to keep in mind when asking questions.

### Make sure your question is in scope

Every Codidact site has its own guidelines for what topics are able to be asked about on that site. You wouldn't want to ask about frying eggs on [Writing](https://writing.codidact.com), or bicycle maintainence on [Cooking](https://cooking.codidact.com). See [$SiteName's scope guidelines here](/help/faq).

If your question isn't in scope for this site, you can check out our [list of communities](https://codidact.com) to see if another site fits your needs. If what you're looking for isn't there, you can always propose a new site on [Codidact Meta](https://meta.codidact.com).

### Do some research

Before asking a new question, first take a look around. Has your question been asked before here on $Sitename Codidact? You can [do a search](/help/search) for keywords related to your question, or take to your favorite search engine to see if your answer is already there on Codidact.

In addition to just making sure your question hasn't been asked already here on Codidact, take a few moments to search beyond the site. If you put your question title into a search engine, can you find the answer to your question in the first three results? If so, perhaps consider [alternative ways of sharing that information](/help/articles-blogs) here on Codidact, or writing a self-answered question to share that knowlege.

### Include your end goal

It's always a good idea to include what exactly you're trying to achieve when you ask a question. It helps to provide context to your question, and can influence answers in ways you possibly hadn't considered.

### Avoid too much subjectivity

Questions like "What's your favorite way to eat an egg?" can't be answered objectively - the answer, naturally, changes depending on who you ask. On the other hand, "What's the difference between hard-boiled eggs and an omelette?" can be answered without relying too much on personal opinions. Try to ask questions that can be answered with some level of objectivity.

### Be specific

Asking really broad questions often isn't very useful. Instead, narrow your question down to ask about one thing in particular. Asking "How do I care for a basil plant?" would need several full-size books to answer, but "When should I harvest my basil leaves?" is much more manageable. Be specific when asking a question, and don't ask questions that would need answers the size of books.

### Does your community or category have any special requirements?

Check out your community help pages to see if they have any special Q&A requirements. For example, they might require a photo, technical specifications, or have a template for you to follow. Gather any information you might need before starting your question.

## Writing your question

### Include details

The more details you include in your question, the better. Include any details that are relevant to your question, no matter how small - you never know what might be relevant!

### Include examples and sources

When you're asking a question, it's almost always a good idea to include your *sources* and/or examples, depending on what exactly your question is about. You can almost always find a source to include that will provide some background information on whatever you're asking about; and including an example to show us what you're talking about, whether that's a photo, a writing sample, code fragment, or anything else, helps to improve your question.

### Writing the question can help you understand the question

Sometimes the act of writing out your question helps you notice important details, and can even change what you end up asking in the end. You start out thinking you have a question about omelettes and, in writing it, realize that your question is really about skillets. This is why, when asking a question, we ask you to write the question out first and then give it a title. By the time you've explained your problem in the question body you should have discovered a clear, succinct title, which is the first thing people will see. Good questions have good titles.

### Include a good title

Your title should explain the problem you're trying to solve. Try to summarize your goal so that someone knows if they can answer it before clicking on the question. Be specific but concise. 

*Avoid*: Help! 

*Avoid*: Help! Unicorn trouble.

*Not a question (avoid)*: Unicorns are in my garden. 

*Good*: How can I keep unicorns from jumping over my garden fence?

### Use good writing practices

We don't expect anyone to have perfect English, but it's a lot easier to understand your question if you follow some basic writing rules. 

- Use paragraphs (a double line-break in Markdown). Separating ideas into their own sections makes your question much easier to read than a wall of text. Additional formatting help can be found [here](/help/formatting). 
- Capitalize the first word of your sentences, and end a sentence with a period. 
- Avoid long, run-on sentences. Be concise. 
- Don't use specialzed jargon or acronyms. If you do use a specialized term that may be unfamiliar to your audience, be sure to define it. 

### Proofread

Make sure to read through your question preview before posting. Put yourself in the shoes of another site-user, and make sure you can easily understand the problem without additional context. Clarify anything that is unclear, and fix any grammatical or formatting errors you notice. Often reading out loud will help you catch awkward phrasing. 

### Add tags. 

Tags help community members filter questions by topic. Look for preexisting tags that fit your subject, or create your own if necessary. 

# After posting 

### Follow up on comments and suggested edits

Despite your best intentions, you might have left out a crucial piece of information needed to answer your question. If you get comments requesting clarification or additional information, take them seriously; everyone is trying to help.
