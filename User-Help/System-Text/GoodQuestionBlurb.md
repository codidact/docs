# Tips for writing a good question

- Your title should be a one sentence summary of your question. 
- Break different topics up into paragraphs. Multiple paragraphs are easier to read than a wall of text. 
- Use clear, simple language. Be specific. 
- Reread your post before saving (preferably out loud) and rewrite anything that sounds awkward. 
- Give context for your question. Tell us what you're trying to do and why.  
- Tell us what you've already tried. 
- Don't provide irrelevant information; it's a distractor from the question you want answered.
