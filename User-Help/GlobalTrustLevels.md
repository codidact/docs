<!--- Explanation of what Trust Levels, how they are calculated, and how to earn then -->

# Trust Level Overview

Since Codidact is community run, it doesn't have "owners" who dictate behavior. Instead, users who consistently make solid contributions through posting and other activity on a community gradually obtain more privileges and begin have access to certain moderation tools. You can see current "Trust Level" on any user's profile. 

Some communities may have a higher bar to obtain trust levels than others, or restrict certain categories based on trust level. The default settings are listed below, but check out your site's FAQ to see if they have any custom requirements. 

# Trust Levels and associated permissions

There are five trust levels with increasing access and levels of responsibility. The table below shows the typical community settings for each.

# Glossary of terms

## Prerequisites

Minimum activity required to reach a given trust level.

## Posts

Typically posts are questions. However, they can also include other formats like blogs or wikis.

## Responses 

A response is a standalone reply to a post, typically a fully researched answer to a question. It may be something else depending on format, e.g. a submission to a contest. 

## Comments

A comment, in comparison to a response, is a short insert to either a post or comment. It usually used for clarification or to request more information. 

## Flags

Flags send a user contribution to a moderation queue for review. They should be used only in the case of material that breaks the Code of Conduct or Terms of Service. 

## Upvotes

Upvotes help a post or answer gain visibility and act as an indicator of how the community values the contribution. They are also used in combination with downvotes to determine if it is well-received. 

## Suggest edits

Sometimes a user's contribution needs a little help. This could be grammar or formatting related, or maybe important information is only contained in a comment. Suggesting edits helps improve the quality of a site's content.

## Suggest duplicates

You may not have been the first person to ask this question! Duplicates aren't necessarily a bad thing, but for people looking for information it's helpful to have links to any previous posts on the same topic. 

## Downvotes

Downvotes are the negative analogue to upvotes. They are used to reduce the visibility of low quality contributions. They are also used in the calculation of whether or not a particular contribution is well-received. 

## Vote-to-lock

Some contributions just aren't a great fit. They might be off-topic, or unclear without additional information from the original poster. In these cases the best thing to do is often to lock the post so it's no longer able to accept responses. Users can vote to lock a post based on certain categories (each associated with a community Meta post explaining why). A certain threshold of close votes vs. non-close votes must be met before a post is closed. 

## Direct edits

Sometimes a user isn't responsive or their post really needs some help or it will be closed. In this case it's possible for the higher users to make changes directly instead of just suggesting. 
 
## Review flags and suggested edits

Flags and suggested edits go into a moderation queue for approval. Higher trust level users can review these and take action if necessary. 

## Create tags

Creating tags is a difficult task, as they need to be generic enough to be commonly chosen, while also not duplicating other existing tags. Currently this functionality is limited to users with enough experience to have a good idea of what to look for in a tag. 

## Protect posts

If a post is controversial or has attracted low quality answers, sometimes the moderation team will restrict answering to users with a higher trust level.

## Temporarily lock posts

Similar to protection, sometimes the moderation team needs to lock a post to keep discussion from getting out of hand, or to give the original poster a chance to add more information. 

## Soft-delete posts

A soft deletion hides posts from general view. Used primarily for inappropriate topics and spam where closing is insufficient.
 
## Soft-delete comments

Same soft-deletion for posts. 

## Permanently lock posts

Locking a post means no further edits or responses can be made. 

## Suspend specific user permissions

If any of the privileges on this list are being abused, moderators can remove any and all of them. Primarily used to combat spammers or individuals abusing the site. 

## Sent private messages to users

Sometimes moderators need to reach out to users privately if they seem to be having issues, have something that requires personal information, or anything else better handled in private. 

## Annotate users

If a particular user has caused trouble in the past or has issues that moderators need to be aware of in the future, members of the moderation team can leave a private note on their user card. This is completely hidden from anyone except full moderators. 

## View private messages and annotations

Moderators can view private messages and notes left by other moderators.  

## Access to all other moderation tools 

If and when additional moderator tools are developed, they will all be accessible to the full moderation team. 

## Well-received questions

The "score" of a post or answer is based on a ratio of upvotes to total votes, weighted to favor answers with a low variance. This gives a slight boost to contributions that are consistently viewed positively over more controversial answers with both upvotes and downvotes.
