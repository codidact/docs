# Trust Level Overview

Codidact sites are run by the community and moderated by trusted members. Users who consistently make high-quality contributions to a community via posting and other activity gradually obtain more privileges and access to certain moderation tools based on a calculated "Trust Level." You can see current Trust Level on any user's profile. 

Some communities may have a higher bar to obtain trust levels than others, or restrict certain categories based on trust level. The default settings are listed below, but check out your site's FAQ to see if they have any custom requirements. 

# Trust levels and associated permissions

There are six trust levels with increasing access and levels of responsibility. The table below shows the typical community settings for each.

# Glossary of terms

### Prerequisites

Minimum activity required to reach a given trust level.

### Posts

Posts are the questions and answers, blogs and articles that compose the core of Codidact. Comments are not considered posts.

### Responses 

A response is a standalone reply to a post, typically a complete and well-informed answer to a question. It may be something else depending on category, e.g. a submission to a contest, but its intent is distinctly different from a comment.

### Comments

A comment, in comparison to a response, is a short note referring to either a post, response or another comment. It is usually used for clarification or to request more information.

### Flags

Flags send a user contribution to a moderation queue for review. Use these to mark obsolete comments or answers, material inappropriate for a particular site, or anything that breaks the Code of Conduct or Terms of Service. 

### Upvotes

Upvotes help a post or answer gain visibility and act as an indicator of how the community values the contribution. They indicate that a question is useful, well-written, and helpful to other users of the site. They are also used in combination with downvotes to determine if it is well-received. 

### Suggest edits

Sometimes a contribution could use a little help. This could be due to grammar and formatting issues, or maybe the original poster has mentioned important information in a comment and needs to add it to the original post. Suggesting edits helps improve the quality of a site's content.

### Suggest duplicates

You may not have been the first person to ask this question! When that happens, adding a link to to the prior post helps you and everyone else find the answers more quickly. 

### Downvotes

Downvotes are the negative analogue to upvotes. They are used to reduce the visibility of contributions with low value to the community. Often they signal that a post is hard to understand or incomplete, or that an answer is wrong or off-topic. They are also used in the calculation of whether or not a particular contribution is well-received. 

### Vote-to-hold

Some questions might be off-topic, or unclear without additional information from the original poster. In these cases it's best to put a temporary hold on response until the original poster updates the question. All holds will come with an explanation, and will be removed once the necessary edits are made.

### Direct edits

Often a post can be improved in some way. This could be anything from adding formatting to help improve clarity, fixing a broken link or adding a reference, or adding contextual information from a comment. Once a user has reached the higher trust levels, they are encouraged to make improvements directly instead of just suggesting. 
 
### Review flags and suggested edits

Flags and suggested edits go into a moderation queue for approval. Higher trust level users can review these and take action if necessary. 

### Create tags

Creating tags is a difficult task, as they need to be generic enough to be commonly chosen, while also not duplicating other existing tags. Currently this functionality is limited to users with enough experience to have a good idea of what to look for in a tag. 

### Lock posts

Similar to post protection, sometimes the moderation team needs to temporarily lock a post to avoid an edit war, or lock comments to let users cool off. Locked questions can still be answered, and voting is still allowed.  

### Delete posts

Deletion hides posts from general view. Used primarily for inappropriate topics and spam where locking is insufficient.
 
### Delete comments

Same as deletion for posts. 

### Permanently lock posts

Locking a post means no further edits or comments can be made. 

### Suspend specific user permissions

If any of the privileges on this list are being abused, moderators can remove any and all of them. Primarily used to combat spammers or individuals abusing the site. 

### Sent private messages to users

Sometimes moderators need to reach out to users in confidence. 

### Annotate users

Moderators can record information about a user that is only visible to other moderators.

### View private messages and annotations

Moderators can view private messages and notes left by other moderators.  

### Well-received questions

The "score" of a post or answer is based on a ratio of upvotes to total votes, weighted to favor answers with a low vote variance. This gives a slight boost to contributions that are consistently viewed positively over more controversial answers with both upvotes and downvotes.
