## How to write good alt text

### What is alt text and why should I care about it?

Alt text, or an image description, is what shows up in place of an image when that image fails to load. It's also what a screen reader will read out when someone is using a screen reader to browse the site, as well as what search engines and feeds display. With that in mind, it's an important part of [web accessibility](https://webaim.org/) to include good alt text.

### How do I write good alt text?

Everything depends on the context of the image, but there are a few basic guidelines to keep in mind.

* **The alt text should serve the exact same purpose as the image**

  When you're using an image, it's almost always to serve a purpose. Whether that's for demonstration, or to show an example, you're including an image for a reason. 
  The alt text should serve the exact same purpose in your post as the image. Anything that's important and *relevant to your post* that's contained in your image should also be contained in the alt text.

* **Don't include unnecessary or redundant details**

  If you've already stated something in the text of your post, there's usually no need to repeat it in the alt text. 
  Don't get bogged down trying to include *every bit of detail* in the image. Only include whatever details from the image are actually relevant to your post - focus on the important parts.

As a general rule, if it would be theoretically possible for you to entirely replace your image with the alt text, without your post losing usefulness or clarity, you're good to go.
