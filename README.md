# [Codidact: The Open-Source Q&A Platform](https://codidact.org/)

**Ever had a question? Ever had an answer?** Ever had knowledge to share? We believe that coming together to inquire and learn, to share knowledge and to teach each other, makes the world a better place. We also believe that Q&A communities should be free from the politics and shenanigans of private, profit-focused companies.

Codidact is an open-source, community-run Q&A platform; by the community, for the community. You can learn more about the project as a whole on the [project homepage](https://codidact.org). You can view our currently existing communities at https://codidact.com. The main software that powers our network can be found in the [QPixel repository](https://github.com/codidact/QPixel).

This repository hosts documentation about the project in the [wiki](https://github.com/codidact/docs/wiki), as well as the repository itself storing our developer documentation and help pages for our sites.

Join our development [Discord server](https://discord.gg/WZ7aTst) to chat about the project, or check out our [meta site](https://meta.codidact.com).

We also share a number of ideals and goals with the [TopAnswers project](https://github.com/topanswers/topanswers) - you may like to see what they're up to as well.
