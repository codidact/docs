# Installation Guides

There are many different ways you can create a development environment to contribute code to Qpixel.

## Local/direct installation
You can install QPixel on your machine directly. A guide is provided for [Linux](/installation/linux).

## Containers
Installing to your local machine can be challenging or impossible due to environment specific considerations (such as conflicting database/ruby versions).

You can set up QPixel in a containerized environment. Everything you need to develop will be set up for you and isolated, so you don't need to worry about following complicated instructions or conflicting dependencies. There are [instructions](/installation/containers) on how to set this up.
